<p>I have been deciding to write my &quot;year in review&quot; for about a month now. I thought I didn't have anything to share but I suppose I was being narrow minded. My life had changed drastically, and I have become a better well rounded person.</p>
<p>We moved to Norway. Moving continents without a lot of support was a lot of hard work. Post move, it was also difficult to adjust to a much lower temperature. Bangalore was 15-25. In Norway 15-18 is supposed to be a great summer temperature.</p>
<p>I got a job at a machine learning startup as a python system dev with some lightweight devops. It's just 10 minutes walk away from our apartment. I get to learn a lot about managing people. I personally think learning more tech won't have too many surprises. I ended this year becoming a software architect.</p>
<p>I learned to cook. I think I deserve a large round of claps for doing so. Well, it isnt much, but I can whip up a good meal given 3 hours. Not a magician, but quite good, even if I say so myself.</p>
<p>I have a very, very small garden. Its mostly herbs. But I do plan to be a lot more active from now. It uses grow lights and a timer. Just need to get the watering part automated.</p>
<p>Rupsa got me an activity tracker. It's something I didn't know I needed. Using this, I try to walk about 7500 steps a day and watch my diet. It has made my moods much better and I am much happier.</p>
<p>I am learning to drive. I understand it's <em>meh</em> for a lot of people, but I sure am loving it!</p>
<p>Now let's see if I can list out the things I want:</p>
<p>I want to read more, less netflix. More novels. More learning.</p>
<p>I want to get a driving license. Here in Norway it needs a lot of commitment and is more of a long term process.</p>
<p>I wish I could say more, but the only thing I am certain about life is how uncertain it is!</p>
