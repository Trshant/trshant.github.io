<p>Following <a href="https://trshant.dev/2019/01/27/A-note-on-docker.html">A note on docker</a>, I decided to get a LAMP setup up using the only docker. However, I procrastinated for almost 3 months before the urge became too much to fight and I gave in and wanted to fight the good fight üòõ Anyway, this post took almost 5 days to get done. so let us get to it.</p>
<p>First, I downloaded Docker and Docker-compose. I followed the official setup and finally got everything working. Docker-compose took a day to get installed properly, but it was mostly a badly installed python distribution that was causing the issue.</p>
<p>Once that was done, I created a folder and put in 2 files in it. Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml. it is linked in the link to the gist and you will be done. However, coming up with the exact file took a fair bit of time - in my case, almost 3 days.</p>
<p>A friend told me that I should use the base images given in the docker hub and work on those to get what I want. So I made the <a href="%5Bhttps://gist.github.com/Trshant/e06bebd178915a7a025339c4bd5e5d94#file-dockerfile%5D(https://gist.github.com/Trshant/e06bebd178915a7a025339c4bd5e5d94#file-dockerfile)">Dockerfile</a> to get a base PHP/Apache image and wrote the remaining parts to install all the other extensions, so I would get a fully fledged system I could use anytime.</p>
<p>Post that I read up on Docker-compose and realized I better get started with writing a YAML file to detail out all the details. This has been carefully <a href="https://gist.github.com/Trshant/e06bebd178915a7a025339c4bd5e5d94#file-docker-compose-yml">commented</a>) and I hope that the comments are good enough explanation.</p>
<p>Then all I needed to do was go over to that directory and do a <code>sudo docker-compose build</code> and post that <code>sudo docker-compose up</code>.</p>
<p>Cheers! üçª</p>
