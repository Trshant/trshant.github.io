<p>Today as i was working, i just realised how amazing my editor is. <br>
I have been trying to learn vi from about a decade. its been on and off….</p>

<p>To adjust to vi, i started lessening my expectations from any editor.  <br>
The least i wanted is <br>
1. Syntax highlighting <br>
2. Line numbering <br>
3. A system compatible with Ctrl-C/X / Ctrl-V. For better or for worse, i havent been able to adapt to vi’s system.</p>

<p>About 2-3 months back, i downloaded sublime text to see what the noise was all about…and it blew my mind. i took to it like a duck to water. It looks beautiful. and very, very 'hackerish' From then till now, i have adapted a few things to my specific use. i have added packages and themes…and i have made a few config changes to suit me.</p>

<p>This is for noobs.</p>

<p>Packages i installed: <br>

<p>Here’s how you go about personalising your install of sublimetext: <br>
1. I used <a href="https://packagecontrol.io/docs/usage">Package Control</a> to install all the packages. And this is how <a href="https://packagecontrol.io/installation">one installs it</a>.  <br>
2. Install all the plugins and themes using PackageManager. Go there via <code>Preferences -&gt; Package Control</code> and type in <code>install packages</code> in the input area. <br>
3. Install all the fonts on your system. ( Do some googling! ) <br>
4. Go to <code>Preferences -&gt; Settings - User</code>, And paste all the config file i have shown above there. Or if you are feeling comfortable and adventurous, Do copy only what you need.  <br>
5. Restart SublimeText.</p>
