<p>My motive in writing this is to understand how a client facing JavaScript framework works at a deeper level. This, i believe, will help me understand the underlying system so i can architect the system correctly. Such kind of frameworks are evolved, so the nomenclature and the way of functioning, is almost the same on a superficial level. i will not be going into any code here. i will only be writing it from a 200ft view.<br />
Recently, i started reading through VueJS and somehow it seems to resonate with me, so i decided to read only the documentation and understand how everything comes together. Below are what i learned.</p>
<h2 id="terms-i-should-know-about">Terms i should know about.</h2>
<h3 id="instance">Instance</h3>
<p>This provides a context ( or <strong>Scope</strong> ) for the application to work with. While you can have multiple instances on a page, it mostly is better to use just one since it simplifies things later.</p>
<h3 id="component">Component</h3>
<p>This can be thought of as a collection of visually separate elements. these can be global or local, and flexibe enough to reuse the same components for different purposes</p>
<h3 id="directive">Directive</h3>
<p>the logic flow of the data is managed by directives. I will deal with this in the next post where i will be looking at code.</p>

<h2 id="an-example">An example</h2>
<p>I am going to look at a blogâ€™s front page layout and see if i can make this into a VueJS application. Visually this can be separated into components.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/HlMWRaK.jpg" alt="Layout of components" /></p>

<p>Now we can see 1 instance, 3 different components, one of which is used 2 times with different data. Just so that we get this right avoiding too much confusion about what goes where, i will concentrate on the components:</p>

<p><strong>header</strong> - This is just the header, with a list of links and a banner image.<br />
<strong>list_posts_with_description</strong> - This component gives a list of post titles, with a date and description. <br />
<strong>list_of_post_titles</strong> - This component gives a list of post titles. it is reused twice. once to show the list using date as the grouping  and the second time using a tag as the grouping.</p>

<p>In the next post, i will write the code for each of the components.
