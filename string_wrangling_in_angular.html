<p>This is what i had originally coded a few days back to get a part of the page working.</p>

<pre><code>FForm.prototype._showBreadcrumbs = function( ) {
    var ster = "&amp;nbsp;";
    if ( window.CollegeName === "" || typeof(CollegeName) === "undefined" ){
        ster = "&amp;nbsp;" ;
        $('.breadcrumbs').html(ster);
    }
    else if ( window.CollegeName !== "" ){
        ster = "You are writing a review for "+CollegeName;
        $('.breadcrumbs').html(ster);
    }

    if ( window.CourseName === "" || typeof(CourseName) === "undefined" ){
    }
    else if ( window.CollegeName !== "" ){
        ster = "You are writing a review for "+CourseName + " in "+CollegeName ;
        $('.breadcrumbs').html(ster);
    }

    if ( window.MajorName === "" || typeof(MajorName) === "undefined" ){
    }
    else if ( window.MajorName !== "" ){
        ster = "You are writing a review for "+CourseName + " in "+MajorName +" in "+ CollegeName  ;
        $('.breadcrumbs').html(ster);
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>However since i had to convert this to angular, the code became </p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class="breadcrumbs"&gt;
  &amp;nbsp;
  &lt;span ng-show="CollegeName" &gt;You are writing a review for&lt;span/&gt; 
  &lt;span ng-show="CourseName"  &gt;{% ng CourseName %} in &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span ng-show="MajorName"   &gt;{% ng MajorName %} in &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span ng-show="CollegeName" &gt;{% ng CollegeName %}.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>AngularJSâ€™s 2 way  binding really makes things easy for developers.</p>
