This is definitely something to understand how to design your classes and methods to interact with other classes. another important use would be to  change contexts while programming. see above. the program here is written with reference to the user, i.e., noun based, and keeping the verb as the context, we program the nouns around it. but we can also write atomic functions where the noun is the context and the verb is passed to it. This is a functional programming paradigm and can ease the software design process there too.Also, do read the footnote link1. It explains a lot more than my post does.

        "content": "Do read through AWS in simple english1 to figure out what we are going to do here. What we are trying to accomplish is simply to host a static site.This involves us:  Setting up the server (called EC2 in AWS language).  Making sure that the outer world has access to our server (setting up the group permisions).  Ensuring FTP access is enabled (so that we can upload files to the server)( changing the group permissions to ensure everything is allowed inside ).So first we log in to the AWS console2. Do put in your card details to complete the registration process.Move to the EC2 page3 . Click on the Launch Instance under the ‘Create Instance’. Then follow the steps below:  Select a suitable instance ( the first one listed, Amazon AMI, is perfect for all our needs ), click on the next button.  Select the correct instance type (t2 micro is perfect for this).  The other 3 panels, Configure instance, Add Storage and Add Tags, can be skipped, but I suggest reading everything once, just in case you need it further when you are on your own.  The Configure Security Group step is needed to enable traffic to the server. The default is add a new group. keep that selected. When adding the rules, select the type as ‘All’, source as ‘0.0.0.0/0’ and go to the next step.  ‘Review and Launch’. This gives you a summary of the selected options over the last 6 steps. and then…  Launch it!Now the server is up and running. We need to SSH into it to install the packages and then start the server.Get a key pair4. Save the resulting .pem file safely. Use this to log into your server by SSH: ssh -i linkToPEMFile ec2-user@PublicDnsIpOnce in, Follow the instructions on this page5 to install the important packages for a LAMP server.Then, type in sudo service httpd start This should result in an OK. Then we can see the page using the Public DNS (IPv4) address. Now your server is online and ready to display pages.Next up, we will use FTP to upload files to the server. This page will tell you exactly how to go about it6. However the key thing here is the PEM file, this called the key pair, read up on this here4.  Also, remember that adding additional users is as simple7 as on a normal linux box.

Think of it being in the “line of sight”, where line of sight is on the same level or below.context means the dependence of the variable on being in an environment. This is used for methods in objects mainly, since the context can change for every instance of the object.However, we can change the context for any method by using the call or apply function. Do go through  2 - its fun and will give you intuition as to scope and contexts .Also, i would like to mention that 3 and 4 helped a lot in making this post look kind of academic.            just one of the many!

Map is a process where, essentially, we process each data element ( calling it a key ) and put up our findings against it ( And call it a value ). We then perform the reduce operation on it, running a operation of aggregation on this emitted value, so that we can get the required result.Since this is a tutorial for using mapreduce for mongodb, we will start with creating a database to use on this.References:  Mapreduce for the family  Can your programming language do this?

        "content": "In this post I will be laying out an idea of how to build a front page for a blog using the components, instances laid out in my previous post, using directives to achieve our goal. But I will need to understand the idea behind this so This post will be about learning and be testing things out, this will help me in taking good decisions finishing the blog code. Along the way, I will be writing code to test my ideas. So, writing a small page to test my code, I begin with forking the hello world example from the official guide.&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;  &lt;title&gt;My first Vue app&lt;/title&gt;  &lt;!-- development version, includes helpful console warnings --&gt;  &lt;script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;  &lt;div id=\"app\"&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;script&gt;    var app = new Vue({      el: '#app',      data: {        message: 'Hello Vue!'      }    })  &lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;Now, if you copy that into an HTML file and then open it, you will be greeted with a “Hello Vue!” message. If you open your console log and type in app.message = “Hello Trshant!”, you will find that the message has changed to whatever you typed. This means that the data in the app is coupled with the  part of the HTML; and if we change the data using ajax, it will make the necessary change in the presentation. awesome!Moving on, I have copied this lovely todo app made in Vue and forked it -&gt; There you go. Do please open it and go thru the code and the example itself. I will go through this and explain the functionality of every line. my motive here is to understand the need for bindings and presentation logic.I will be going thru the HTML and then the JS. But before we do that, we will ask ourselves the important questions - The Objective/Brief of our task.We want to build a small to-do app. This should have a text box and a button next to it, on the top. when you type in something and hit the button or press enter, this should populate underneath, with a checkbox to its left. we also need a delete button. When you click the checkbox, the text should be struck out.Since we have some clarity on what we need, we move on to the code. Do have a look:&lt;!-- Main Div Holding our Application Data --&gt;&lt;div class=\"container\" id=\"todo\"&gt;  &lt;!-- Panel for holding our input --&gt;  &lt;section class=\"panel\"&gt;    &lt;input type=\"checkbox\" id=\"mark-all\" v-bind:checked=\"areAllSelected\" v-on:click=\"selectAll\"&gt;    &lt;input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"What do you need to do?\" autofocus class=\"text-input\" v-model=\"newTask\" v-on:keyup.enter=\"addTask\"&gt;    &lt;button v-on:click=\"clearList\"&gt;Clear List&lt;/button&gt;  &lt;/section&gt;  &lt;!-- Unordered list for holding our todo items --&gt;  &lt;ul class=\"list\"&gt;    &lt;li v-for=\"task in taskList\" v-bind:class=\"{done: task.checked}\"&gt;      &lt;input type=\"checkbox\" class=\"checkbox\" v-model=\"task.checked\"&gt;      &lt;label for=\"checkbox\"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;      &lt;button class=\"delete\" v-on:click=\"removeTask(task)\"&gt;X&lt;/button&gt;    &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;!-- This stringifies the contents of the data object and displays it on the page --&gt;  &lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The main input with button : look at the contents of the &lt;section class=\"panel\"&gt; element. So we have a checkbox (which is not in the brief above the code), an input and a button. All this is in HTML..but whats the v-on and v-bind and v-model?These are called directives. They are very very important and so, we should understand what they do. These are event listeners and provide binding with the data source or functions that we will build.Here, we have a few directives. I will list them and provide an explanation:  v-bind: This binds an attribute of the element with the output of a function, which is constantly evaluated, or some data element. here we see v-bind:checked=\"areAllSelected\" - this binds the output of a constantly evaluated function areAllSelected to the checked property of the checkbox.  v-on: This is an event listener. This executes a function on the occurrence of that event. v-on:click=\"selectAll\" - here the function selectAll is executed when the click event executes on this element. Another instance of the v-on is the v-on:keyup.enter=\"addTask\". Intuitively, you can say that this is supposed to execute addTask on the event of the enter button is released.  v-model: This binds the data to the element value when that value is an attribute.We will now go through the rest of the code - the ul element. We encounter something different here - the v-for=\"task in taskList\" bit. This is a ‘for’ loop. it loops through each element ( called task ) in the data taskList.I think we can now go thru the Javascript and will find it self-explanatory. ",

        "content": "My motive in writing this is to understand how a client facing JavaScript framework works at a deeper level. This, i believe, will help me understand the underlying system so i can architect the system correctly. Such kind of frameworks are evolved, so the nomenclature and the way of functioning, is almost the same on a superficial level. i will not be going into any code here. i will only be writing it from a 200ft view.Recently, i started reading through VueJS and somehow it seems to resonate with me, so i decided to read only the documentation and understand how everything comes together. Below are what i learned.Terms i should know about.InstanceThis provides a context ( or Scope ) for the application to work with. While you can have multiple instances on a page, it mostly is better to use just one since it simplifies things later.ComponentThis can be thought of as a collection of visually separate elements. these can be global or local, and flexibe enough to reuse the same components for different purposesDirectivethe logic flow of the data is managed by directives. I will deal with this in the next post where i will be looking at code.An exampleI am going to look at a blog’s front page layout and see if i can make this into a VueJS application. Visually this can be separated into components.Now we can see 1 instance, 3 different components, one of which is used 2 times with different data. Just so that we get this right avoiding too much confusion about what goes where, i will concentrate on the components:header - This is just the header, with a list of links and a banner image.list_posts_with_description - This component gives a list of post titles, with a date and description. list_of_post_titles - This component gives a list of post titles. it is reused twice. once to show the list using date as the grouping  and the second time using a tag as the grouping.In the next post, i will write the code for each of the components.",
