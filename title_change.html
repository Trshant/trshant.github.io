<p>From the time i programmed this blog i wondered how to change the title of the page to display the title i wanted to show the page by, but i always thought it would have something to do with services. However after a few evenings spent reading the manual did nothing to address this issue. However, today i just thought that maybe we can do the whole thing using JavaScript.</p>
<p>I was under the impression that i needed to add a change_the_title function as the object returned by one of the services. However it was stupidly simple.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
document.title = post.title
</pre>
<p>Yes, thats what i had to add to make at the right place to do the needful.</p>
<p>Moral of the story: Think Simple, Stupid!</p>
<p>I do have plans to add a nice backend to my blog system to make blogging better. and some simple analytics too. Watch this space for more interesting and amazing things in the near future!</p>
