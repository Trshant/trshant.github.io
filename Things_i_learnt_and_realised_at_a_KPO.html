<p>My new job is to automate the work at a KPO. I realised a few things from a day spent there, and i am listing them out here.</p>

<ol>
<li>Code does have an expiry date, and even if people do find it <em>workable</em> or whatever, it will still need to be rewritten, so that the code is atleast relevant. Programmers should understand and internalise this fact and not fight it.</li>

<li>Do not aim for basic pay. However much the company automates or computer intelligence increases, there will always be work for the expert. infact, only the expert will have work. So people have to specialise in any one action. Regardless of how intelligent computers have become, human intelligence is still the best there is.</li>

<li>Programmers can be easily replaced. We are so dependant on libraries and automated code generators, that code today is more interplay between these separate libraries than crafting something meticulously keeping all the factors and limitations in mind. inspite of all these factors, we can produce software that will help save valuable time and we should.</li>
</ol>

<p>I am sure this is not the end of the things i will learn here. and as i get to learn about things, i will share them with you here.</p>
