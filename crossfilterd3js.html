<h4>An introduction to the libraries</h4>
<p>D3.js is a JavaScript library that used digital data to drive the creation and control of dynamic and interactive forms in HTML, SVG and CSS.</p>

<p>Crossfilter.js is a Javascript Library used to explore large datasets, to support extremely fast interaction with coordinated data views. We can use any variable in the data to create multiple ( up to 16 ) dimension through which to group the data. Any filtering action on any of the dimensions will cause the data in the other dimensions to be filtered also. Not only that, the original dataset can also be added to or removed from ( as in a live, dynamic dataset ) while having all the dimensions and filters in place and the data in these dimensions will also be changed according to the new dataset.</p>

<p>Crossfilter.js library's data sifting capabilities along with d3.js power of easily creating interactable data visualisation, gives the developer to easily create and edit visualisations to help the user a chance to see and understand the data.</p>
 
<p>Nvd3.js is a JavaScript library that makes creating and updating charts easy while using d3.js for the data. We are using this library because it makes the creation of charts very easy. In this example, the scatterplot is being created by this library<p>
<h4>About this example</h4>
<p>The dataset is created each time the data loads. the user can use the brush in the bar graph to select the interval over which the data should selected.</p>
