As years go, this one has been the most special by far. Let me list them out below:

1. I am a father to a beautiful girl. The Pregnancy was a tough one with a medical emergency at the end, but all's well that ends well. 

      My daughter is named Ellora. She is about 5 months old. Favorite time of the day is 1300 and night is 0200. Loved to be taken for walks , is fairly talkative and demands our undivided attention. We get paid in smiles, giggles and joy.

1. We really cooked a lot this year. Various cuisines. Thai, Indonesian, Norwegian, Brazilian, Japanese, Mangalorean, Bengali, Gujarati are the ones I remember. 
2. I drove a lot. In Agder and one trip to Oslo to get my wife and newborn daughter.  Love driving long distances  now. We got a new car. A fully electric nissan leaf.  Absolutely enjoy it. 

I hope the next year, i can be a better person, with less procastination, and would like to again restart figuring out many newer things in programming.
