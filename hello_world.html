Hi Guys,
</h3>
<p>
Its been a long time since i added anything to my blog. It isnt that i havent been busy; just that i have been having too much to do.
</p>

<p>
From the last time we met, i have studied some Math, A little AI, A little ML and done a shit load of PHP and javascript programming. However since i have been learning so much but programming all that was daunting, i learned a new language - R. It makes difficult things easy, and i have studies effortlessly because of this tool
</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
str <- "Hello, World!"
str
</pre>
<p>
I do not plan on making tutorials of this amazing language on this blog. I learned this as a part of studying statistics on Coursera, and didnt stop :). What i do plan to do is to show all the things i studied in my blog, using R to demonstrate things.
